  <h2 id="browsefeed">Browse the Community</h2>
            
           Water Reporter’s Activity Feed is a great way to stay on top of all the latest reports being shared by our active user base.  It serves as a convenient launch pad for commenting on a report of interest, sharing a report to social media, and even getting turn by turn directions to the location.  Our aim is to make it as easy as possible to stay up to date on the latest community activity while being exposed to observations and reports from a diverse array of watersheds.  Below are a few ways you can interact with reports shared by our community members.


          <h3>Interacting with the Feed</h3>

          <p>Each report consists of simple routes to additional content or actions.  Starting with the top of the report and working our way down, users will see the community member who posted, their profile picture (if applicable), date of the report, and the watershed it was shared from.  Tap on the user’s profile picture to learn more about them, view a list of their observations, any actions taken, as well as view the groups they belong to.  Under the report photo you can find a helpful toolbar, report description (if provided) as well as hashtags for categorizing the report (if provided).</p>

         Posting reports to Water Reporter is a fast and easy way to build a living map of your experiences on your favorite lake, river, or ocean.  Each observation allows you to add a photo, some comments and hashtags, as well as a location.  If you are using Water Reporter as part of an organization led citizen science or pollution reporting campaign, you can conveniently share reports directly to a group.  In this section of the help docs, we’ll go through some tips that will make sharing your observations even easier.

  <h3 id="postwr">What happens next?</h3>

           <p>We post your report to the community and make it available for everyone to see.  If you’ve shared your report with an organization, we’ll make sure they are notified via email.   Water Reporter will also affiliate the appropriate watershed with your report so that it can be explored by others.</p>

           <div class="callout callout-info" role="alert">
              <h4>Helpful Tip</h4>
              <p>If you would like to receive emails when someone comments on your report or takes a remedial action, make sure you notifications are switched to “on” in your profile settings</p>
            </div>

<h2 id="hashtags">Using Hashtags</h2>

<p>Hashtags are a fantastic way to categorize all of your reports by a specific topic of interest.  It’s also a useful method for easily viewing other water related observations that are trending within the Water Reporter Community.   You can use hashtag at the time of posting or editing a report as well as within report comments.  To get started using hashtags follow the steps below.</p>

<ul class="step-text">
  <li>
    <h5>Start with report description or comments</h5>
    <p>Begin adding hashtags mid sentence or by appending them to the end of your report.  Add a “#” in front of any word or combination of words.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h5>Select from the dropdown or keep typing</h5>
    <p>As you type a list of suggestions will appear.  Select one that matches or keep typing to create a new one.  Appropriate hashtags look something like this: “#sediment #erosion” that said, we cannot work with things that look like the following: “#sediment#erosion” or “#sediment, #erosion.”</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h5>Keep it simple</h5>
    <p>With hashtags it’s better to use simple short words and phrases.  There is no need to add special characters or punctuation. Here are some great examples of how hashtags will appear in our community:
    <strong> <a href="https://www.waterreporter.org/community/tags/sediment" target="_blank">#sediment</a></strong> or 
      <strong> <a href="https://www.waterreporter.org/community/tags/erosion" target="_blank">#erosion</a></strong>
  
  </li>

</ul>


  <h2 id="sharesocial">Sharing a Report to Social Media</h2>

  <p>Water Reporter makes it easy for community members to share posts outside the community to Twitter and Facebook. This exponentially increases the visibility of your reports and allows you to connect with others who have yet to register for a Water Reporter account. To get started cross posting, follow the simple steps below.</p>

          <h2 id="groups">Groups</h2>
          
          <p>One of Water Reporter’s major roles as a platform is to unite watershed restoration efforts.  Our community’s group features provide an outlet for both organizational leads and everyday Water Reporter users to connect via reports.  Organizations in Water Reporter are active leaders in watershed restoration efforts and currently consist of small watershed organizations, national NGOs, and even government agencies.  Joining an organization in Water Reporter affiliates your profile with their dedicated page, allows you to share reports to support their crowdsourcing initiatives, and work together to actively improve water quality.  Here are some examples of how to get started with groups.</p>

          <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="assets/img/Android-Orgs-Reports.png" style="height:600px" "padding-top: 50px">

          <h3>Why join groups?</h3>
<ul class="step-text">
  <li>
    <h5>Help collect observations for a specific initiative</h5>
    <p>Often organizations in Water Reporter will ask for help from their volunteers to collect observations related to water quality issues such as algae blooms, trash sites, or erosion.  Your reports provide vital data that our organizations can use to inform where cleanups should occur and where restoration should happen.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h5>Stay current with local watershed improvement efforts</h5>
    <p>Groups are a fast and easy way to access and interact with the most recent reports shared by users of similar interests and regions.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h5>Notify an active base of restoration professionals</h5>
    <p>As a unified network, we can work together to identify threats to water quality and take action to improve our local resources.  Sharing a report with a group such as a watershed organization allows all members to be notified and they can take action on your report.</p>
  </li>

    <h3 id="joingroup">How to Join a Group</h3>

    <p>Does your organization have a citizen pollution reporting program? Do you need to easily collect volunteer geo-referenced observations in your watershed?  Water Reporter provides tools for restoration professionals to access reports submitted to the community and track remediation. Collectively, restoration professionals and users are creating a national network of people watching over our waterways.</p>

    <p>As a Water Reporter administrator, you gain access to communication tools that help you reach out to your networks and inform your volunteers of the actions that you and your organization are taking to improve water quality. We are also working to deploy a line of services that will allow you to easily manage, map, and share quantitative water quality monitoring data.</p>
