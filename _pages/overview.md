<p>
  Water Reporter is the easiest way to document and map your experiences on the world's waterways. Use our app to snap a picture while on the river, describe your experience with a few words or hashtags, and share. We’ll keep track of your adventures, add them to the community map, and allow others to explore the world’s lakes, rivers, and oceans as they happen. We built Water Reporter to help tease out local knowledge on how humans interact with the the many watersheds around the globe.
