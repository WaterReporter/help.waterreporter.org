<p>
Does your organization have a citizen pollution reporting program? Water Reporter provides tools for restoration professionals to access volunteer submitted reports in their geographic areas of interest and track remediation. Collectively, restoration professionals and users are creating a national network of people watching over our waterways. As a Water Reporter administrator, you have access to communication tools that help you reach out to your networks and inform your volunteers of the actions you and your organization are taking to improve water quality. We are firm believers that thanks to the ripple effect, we can bring restoration professionals and Water Reporter users across the US online to create a national social network of outdoor enthusiasts, environmentalists, leaders and everyday citizens watching over our nationâ€™s waterways and transparently tracking progress
