<p>
 Hashtags are one of the best ways to describe your report because it enables our system to keep track of trending reports that are relevant to your interests.  Using hashtags will also make it easier to share your reports across other communities with broader user bases such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.  While there are many different ways to use hashtags to spice up a report, the following steps will get you started.
.
</p>


<p>
Sign into the mobile app or through <a href="https://www.waterreporter.org" target="_blank">WaterReporter.org</a> with your registered email and password and start submitting a new report.
</p>

<p>
2. In the report description, take a space and add a “#” in front of any word or combination of words.  
</p>

<p>
3. Remember that an appropriate hashtag is all one word with the “#” in front and has no spaces or special characters.    
</p>

<p>
4. Appropriate hashtags look something like this: “<a href="http://www.waterreporter.org/search?q=%7B%22filters%22:%5B%7B%22name%22:%22report_description%22,%22op%22:%22ilike%22,%22val%22:%22%25%23sediment%25%22%7D%5D,%22order_by%22:%5B%7B%22field%22:%22report_date%22,%22direction%22:%22desc%22%7D,%7B%22field%22:%22id%22,%22direction%22:%22desc%22%7D%5D%7D&page=1" target="_blank">#sediment</a> <a href="http://dev.waterreporter.org/search?q=%7B%22filters%22:%5B%7B%22name%22:%22report_description%22,%22op%22:%22ilike%22,%22val%22:%22%25%23erosion%25%22%7D%5D,%22order_by%22:%5B%7B%22field%22:%22report_date%22,%22direction%22:%22desc%22%7D,%7B%22field%22:%22id%22,%22direction%22:%22desc%22%7D%5D%7D&page=1" target="_blank">#erosion</a>” that said, we cannot work with things that look like the following: “#sediment#erosion” or “#sediment, #erosion.”

Why are we doing this again?  Think of it this way, pretend you launch a campaign that uses Water Reporter to share pictures on <strong>#awesomeaccess</strong> locations or your <strong>#2015trashbash</strong> event.  By getting others to add the same hashtag in their report, we’ll be able to save all the posts associated with your hashtags and enable you to search or access them at any point in time.

Cool right?
