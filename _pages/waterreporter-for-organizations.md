For example, if you are the Upper James Riverkeeper, we can give you single click access to every report that is submitted by you and others in the Upper James drainage basin.

<strong>Track and communicate remediation progress to other Water Reporter users -</strong> Being the catalyst that sparks restoration action is a powerful thing.  With a verified Water Reporter account you and your organization can actively field reports from the community, comment on restoration progress, and even mark the report as resolved.  All restoration actions you take will be saved to your profile and the user who submitted the report will be notified.
