 Do you have something to say and want to connect with others about their reports? Water Reporter allows users to start the conversation by commenting and adding pictures to a report thread.Comments are a great way express concern about  a potential threat to water quality or just let someone know their paddling trip looked like a boat-load of fun.  Remember that anything you say in the community can be seen by the public, so keep the dialogue appropriate for everyone.
